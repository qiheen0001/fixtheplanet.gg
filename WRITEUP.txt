How we came up with the idea:
We came up with the idea with the assistance of Artifical Intelligence (AI). Then we brainstormed a little then got started with the project.
Problems we faced:
  We had decided on our topic quite late, only 2 days before the submission date. This caused us to have to rush the project, and we were unable to make it what we wanted it to be.
The prohibition of plagarism from AI was also another challenge.  Due to our initial code written mostly by AI, we had to redo it and it massively slowed us down because AI codes much faster than us. The code was also greatly handicapped in terms of quality.
How we solved the problem:
  Instead of having a badly-made project that was supposed to be much better, we lowered our expectations and made something smaller that would fit into our timeframe better, so that we were able to make a small project well.
However, we worked as a team and met up to code together. If one did not know the specific code, we would either search it up or ask AI. In the end we managed to pull through.
